This is a preliminary manual for alternative firmware for FlySky FS-GT3B radio
and clones. This manual is written as differences to original firmware.

This firmware is completely written from scratch and is not compatible with the
original Flysky firmware. It is distributed with NO-WARRANTY.
All of the model setups saved by original firmware will be erased!!!
You can backup your original firmware and config, use tabs "PROGRAM MEMORY" and
"DATA MEMORY" in STVP to read it from radio a save it to disk.



Global characteristics:
=======================
- 15 models memory (for 6-channel firmware, for 3-channel it is little more
		    and for 8-channel little less)
    > numbers 10-19 will show with Right-Arrow
    > numbers 20-29 will show with Left-Arrow
- added Subtrims
- added SaveAs to save model config to another memory location
- added Global Setup menu to change function features, including backlight time,
    battery low voltage, etc. 
- dead zone for steering and throttle
- added key mapping specific for each model memory
- calibrate menu will be automatically invoked after first power-on with
  this firmware, so 6 menu items will start to blink


Buttons:
========
- it is now possible to differentiate between long press (>1 second) to
  normal button press (short) and it will be recognized like "ENTER-long"
- Trims and DualRate
    > now shows changed value only temporaly (5 seconds or till another
	key press), values are saved to EEPROm automatically when it disappears
    > when autorepeat disabled on trims (default), reset trim to 0
	by pressing both trim keys together for long
	(eg. TRIM_LEFT-long + TRIM_RIGHT-long and similar for channel 2 trim)
    > while value is showed, it is possible to change it with rotate
        encoder also
    > when value set to reset_value (usualy 0), longer beep sounds to
	attention to it and short pause is intruduced to ignore keys


Standard menu:
==============
- swapped behaviour of ENTER and END when editing items, ENTER now select
    next value and END (+ ENTER-long) will end editing items
- ENTER-long on ABS will leave menu also (as BACK)
- Trims are now only for steering and throttle
- Expo
    > value for channel 2 is splitted to forward and back and is indicated
	by arrows
    > positive values are those You want to use like at Spektrum radios
- DualRate
    > value for channel 2 is splitted to forward and back and is indicated
	by arrows
- SaveAs
    > choose menu MODEL and press ENTER-long
    > menu MODEL will blink
    > choose memory position where to save model config
    > press ENTER/BACK to save it
- Model reset
    > choose menu NAME and press ENTER-long
- Subtrims
    > choose menu TRIM and press ENTER-long
    > menu TRIM will blink
    > set subtrims for each channel
    > press ENTER/BACK to end this submenu
- Steering speed
    > choose menu D/R and press ENTER-long
    > menu D/R wil blink
    > now only channel 1 can be selected
    > turn wheel left to show left arrow - this represents Turn speed 1-100%
    > turn wheel right to show right arrow - this represents Return speed 1-100%
	100% means no delay
	1%   means above 4s delay end to end
- 4WS and DIG mixes
    > choose menu EPOINT and press ENTER-long
    > menu EPOINT will blink
    > select one of mixes 4WS (4) or DIG (d)
    > press ENTER and choose channel for this mix or OFF
    > press ENTER and set mix in range -100...0...100 %
	0%   is default and means both channel have same max steering/throttle
	100% means 100% reduce on rear steering/throttle (eg. no steering)
       -100% means 100% reduce on front steering/throttle (eg. no steering)
    > for 4WS press ENTER and select crab (CRB) or no-crab (NOC)
- Key mapping specific for each model:
    > choose menu REV and press ENTER-long
    > menu REV will blink
    > choose trims (id 1 2 3 d) or other keys (CH3-C, Back-b, End-E) or
        if trim is OFF, then also trim keys (id 1 2 3 d with left/right arrow)
    > press ENTER and modify first setting
    > press ENTER and modify next setting
    > ....

    steps of settings of trims (1 2 3 and D/R):
	- sequence:
	  function -> buttons -> step -> reverse -> opposite_reset -> previous_val
	  id:          %          % V     V          V blinking        % blinking
	- function: selected function listed at the end of manual
	- buttons:
	    MOM - momentary, hold left/right trim key to get end values,
		  when nothing pressed, servo is at centre
	    NOL - no long keys, long press is the same as short press
	    RPT - autorepeat is on
	    RES - long press of one of trim keys will reset to
		  centre/reset value
	    END - long press of trim key will set to coresponding end value
	- step: select trim step for one trim key press (1, 2, ... 100, 200),
		not available when buttons MOM
	- reverse:
	    NOR - no change
	    REV - swap left/right trim keys
	- opposite_reset: not available when buttons MOM
	    NOO - no change
	    ORS - when trim key is pressed and value is at opposite
		  side of centre/reset, set value to centre/reset,
	- previous_val: available only when buttons MOM
	    NPV - no change
	    PRV - instead of setting value to centre/reset when key is released,
		  it is set to previous value, which was active before key press
    -----
    steps of setting of keys (C b E 1< 1> 2< 2> 3< 3> d< d>):
	- sequence:
	  function -> momentary -> reverse -> prev_val -> function_long -> reverse_long -> prev_val_long
	  id:          %            V          % blink     % V              V               % blink
	- function: selected function listed at the end of manual
	- momentary: only available for 2-state functions (channel, ...)
	    SWI - key press will switch something (channel value, ...)
	    MOM - value change will be active only while key is pressed
	- reverse: only available for 2-state functions
	    NOR - no-press or default value is left endpoint
	    REV - no-press or default value is right endpoint
	- prev_val: only available for 2-state functions
	    NPV - key release or OFF state sets value to left endpoint (noREV)
	    PRV - key release or OFF state sets value to value active before
		  key press or ON state
	- function_long: function applied when long press of key happens,
	                 choose from the same list as function
	- reverse_long: same as "reverse"
	- prev_val_long: same as "prev_val"
		   



Calibrate menu:
===============
- enter it by wheel right-turn and ENTER-long
- 6 menu items starts to blink
- use END or ROTATE to change channels
- there is also channel 3 representing CH3 button (for those who will do
    some 3-position switch/potentiometer modification)
- there is also channal 4 representing battery voltage
- calibrate as usual (for channel 1/2 left+mid+right and ENTER)
    > calibrated value will disappear from menu
    > it is not needed to calibrate all values
- calibrate battery (it will not be probably needed to use this)
    > select channel 4
    > press ENTER
    > set your current battery voltage (measure it by voltmeter)
    > press ENTER to save it or END to no-save
- press BACK-long or ENTER-long to end calibrate menu and save values


Key-test menu:
==============
- enter it by wheel left-turn and ENTER-long
- if ENTER-long keep pressed, all segments on display will stay on till
    ENTER is released
- now check keys by pressing them short or long
- if keys long pressed, an "L" symbol will appear left to displayed key symbols
- press BACK-long or ENTER-long to end key-test menu


Global setup menu:
==================
- enter it by ENTER-long
- now menu items MODEL and NAME will start blinking
- select requested item by ROTATE and press ENTER
- use ROTATE to change value and press ENTER to end value changing
- press BACK-long or ENTER-long to end global setup menu,
    values will be saved to EEPROM
- selected menu items are indicated by following symbols:
    F		firmware version (this of course cannot be changed :-)
    L		backlight time			5s,10s...10m...MAX
    A		inactivity alarm		OFF,1m...10m
    LOW POWER!	battery low voltage		7.5...10.5V
    E.POINT	maximum allowed endpoint value	100...150%
		DANGER - values greater than 120% can damage
			    your servo or will not be possible
			    to transmit to receiver because of
			    2.4GHz HF module limitation
		This danger zone will be indicated with a flashing "d" symbol
		  for values greater than 120%
    1		dead zone for steering		0...50
    2		dead zone for throttle		0...50
    b		key beep			OFF/ON
    d		long press key delay		100...1000 miliseconds
    r + ALL	global reset - change to YES to set global configuration
			       and all models to default values
    r + MOD	all models reset - change to YES to set all models
				   to default values



Return to original (and modified) firmware:
===========================================
- flash original firmware
- delete whole EEPROM (tab DATA MEMORY in STVP and write those empty zeroes)
    or return back your saved config (also tab DATA MEMORY in STVP, read
    your saved config from disk and write it to radio)
- calibrate steering and throttle (not needed when You returned back saved
    config)





Functions assignable to trims:
==============================
OFF		- nothing, it is possible to assign each button individualy
		  as key
TR1, TR2	- trim of channel 1/2
DRS, DRF, DRB	- dualrate of steering/forward/back
EXS, EXF, EXB	- expo of steering/forward/back
CHn		- change channel "n" value in range -100...100
STn		- subtrim of channel "n"
4WS		- 4 wheel steering mix -100...100%
DIG		- DIG throttle mix -100...100%
SST		- steering speed turn 1...100%
SSR		- steering speed return 1...100%



Functions assignable to keys:
=============================
OFF		- nothing
CHn		- switch channel "n" value from one end value to opposite end
		  value. There is special handling for CH3 button. When using
		  3-position switch instead of CH3 button and momentary is
		  selected for this button, then centre 3-pos value will also
		  be detected and set to servo (but this was not tested yet,
		  I wouldn't do this modification to my radio).
CnR		- reset value of channel "n" to centre
4WS		- switch crab (CRB) no-crab (NOC) for 4 wheel steering
DIG		- switch DIG mix between -100 and 100 (more useable when using
		  return to previous val key setting)
